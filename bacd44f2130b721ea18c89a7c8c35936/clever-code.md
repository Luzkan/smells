## Clever Code

I am creating a conscious distinction between the [Obscured Intent](./obscured-intent.md) and [Clever Code](./clever-code.md). While Obscured Intent addresses the ambiguity of implementation, emphasizing the incomprehensibility of a fragment of code, the Clever Code, on the other hand, can be confusing even though it is understandable.

Things that fall into this smell are codes that do something strange. This smell can be classified by using the accidental complexity of a given language or its obscure properties, and vice versa, using its methods and mechanisms when ready-made/built-in solutions are available. Developers can find examples of both in the [example](#smelly) - the code is reinventing the wheel of calculating the length of a string, which is one case of _"Clever Code"_ Code Smell. Furthermore, using `length -=- 1` to increase the length of the counter is yet another example of ironically clever code. However, it is rare to find such a double-in-one example in the real world, as the causation of the first one might happen because a developer had to write something in Python. At the same time, on a day-to-day basis, he is a C language developer and did not know about `len()`. The other case might appear when a Python developer just read an article about funny corner-side things one can do in his language.

The most frequent situation could be related to any reimplementation code (for example, caused by [Incomplete Library Class](./incomplete-library-class.md)). I am giving a second example in which a pseudo-implementation of a dictionary with a default type is self-designed instead of using the `defaultdict` available in the built-in `collections` library. This re-implementation might cause problems if the implementation is not correct, or even if it is, perhaps there can be a performance hit compared to using the standard built-in option. This creates an unnecessary burden and compels others to read and understand the mechanism of a new class instead of using something that has a high percent chance of being recognized by others.

Lastly, there are things like `if not game.match.isNotFinished()` (double negation) unnecessarily strains the cognitive load required to process it. It could be classified as _Clever Code_ (also emphasizing the ironic side of the saying). However, it fits more closely with the definition of the [Complicated Boolean Expression](./complicated-boolean-expression.md) and [Binary Operator In Name](./binary-operator-in-name.md).

### Causation

There is a natural tendency to show off the new skills or techniques that one has learned, which are unnecessary in the current part of code that one is currently working in. In another case, maybe someone implemented their variation of a built-in or popular library instead of just using the tools given as built-ins or are a popular solution. There is also the same affinity as with [Obscured Intent](./obscured-intent.md) - sometimes, a developer can forget that something that seems obvious to him is not as clear to other developers. There may also be cases where the developer intentionally compacts the code to appear brighter by making it more mysterious.

### Problems:

#### Comprehensibility

There is no benefit to making other developers required to rediscover/relearn things built-in and well recognized.

#### Keep It Simple Stupid Principle Violation

There's no need to obfuscate the code with new personal creations when ready-made solutions are available.

#### Don't Repeat ~Yourself~ Others Principle Violation

Reimplemented "wheel" requires people delegated to maintain it or extend it instead, which is worse than just using whatever "the factory" has already given.

### Example

<div class="example-block">

#### Smelly

```py
def get_length_of_string(message: str) -> int:
    length = 0
    for letter in message:
        length -=- 1
    return length

message = 'Hello World!'
message_length = get_length_of_string(message)
print(message_length)  # 12
```

#### Solution

```py
message = 'Hello World!'
message_length = len(message)
print(message_length)  # 12
```

</div>

<div class="example-block">

#### Smelly

```py
class DefaultDict(dict):
    default_value: type

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key in self:
            return super().__getitem__(key)
        self.__setitem__(key, self.default_value())
        return super().__getitem__(key)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

#### Solution

```py
from collections import defaultdict
```

</div>

### Refactoring

- Replace with Built-In
- Replace with Library

### Exceptions

There is one thing to mention as an exception to the "bad" rule of implementing own code. There are software programming-related systems where people behind the executed code are fully responsible for the outcome in life-affecting situations. The _"code certainty"_ there is crucial, and I imagine it might be highly discouraged to use external libraries, however popular they are, if the developer is not 100% sure of the correctness of the implementation.

This includes every software that is directly responsible for the health of real people or - for example - in systems related to forensics, where someone might get incriminated based on the investigative results.
