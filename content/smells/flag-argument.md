## Flag Argument

Martin Fowler defines Flag Arguments as a "kind of function argument that tells the function to carry out a different operation depending on its value." [[1](#sources)] There are two reasons why this is smelly. First of all - it can be a candidate for [Boolean Blindness](./boolean-blindness.md) Code Smell. Fowler gives a great example with _Concert_ class and the` book(customer: Customer, is_premium: bool)` method. While reading the code, without knowing much more context, one will be stopped by invocation of this method: `book(marcel, false)` - excuse me, but precisely what "`false`"? The situation is clear if the method is divided into two separate parts instead of using a flag argument. Then, calling a method that provides more meaning through a name like `regularBook(marcel)` is much better in terms of comprehensibility.

The second problem is that it might be a cocoon phase before it develops into a beautiful full-fledged [Conditional Complexity](./conditional-complexity.md). First, what you see is `is_premium: bool`. The second time you come by, it is already transformed to `ticket_type: str,` switching through different options based on the value and the smell of the [Primitive Obsession](./primitive-obsession.md) on top.

### Causation

Quick dirty tweaking can cause them for new features because it might be as easy and tempting as adding `else if` clause to the conditional-checking block. The developer felt that it was just a tiny difference and didn't bother to create a separate method for its implementation.

### Problems

#### **Hard to Read**

In most cases, you will not know what `false` or what `true` is going on until you hover over the method.

#### **Hard to Change**

Boolean as a flag argument implies that a method has two ways of working.

### Example

#### Smelly

```py
class Concert:
    def book(self, customer: Customer, is_premium: bool):
        if is_premium:
            ...
        else:
            ...

book(marcel, false) # ? false what
```

#### Solution

```py
class Concert:
    def book_premium(self, customer: Customer):
        ...

    def book_regular(self, customer: Customer):
        ...

book_regular(marcel)
```

### Refactoring:

- Remove Flag Argument
- Extract Method
