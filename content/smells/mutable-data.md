## Mutable Data

Mutable data are harmful because they can unexpectedly fail other parts of the code. It is a rich source of bugs that are hard to spot because they can occur under rare conditions. Fowler says that this is a significant factor which contributed to the rise of the new programming school, functional programming, in which one of the principles is that the data should never change. While these languages are still relatively small, he states that developers should not ignore the advantages of immutable data [[1](#sources)]. It is hard to reason about these variables, especially when they have several reassignments.

### Causation

In Object-Oriented Programming, the immutability of objects was not addressed audibly, if at all, in the context of something desirable. This is a relatively new concept.

### Problems

#### **Error-Prone**

Mutable Data is a rich source of hidden bugs that might be spotted only when specific rare conditions are met.

#### **Hard to Understand**

Data that might change at any moment is hard to reason about without excluding every corner case.

### Examples

<div class="example-block">

#### Smelly

```py
@dataclass
class Foo:
    name: str
    value: float
    premium: bool

# foo object instance will be passed around and modified
```

#### Solution

```py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Foo:
    name: str
    value: float
    premium: bool

# foo object instance will be passed around and, if that is necessary,
# recreated, thus making the state change explicit for everyone and handled
```

</div>

### Refactoring:

- Remove Setting Method
- Choose Proper Access Control
- Separate Query from Modifier
- Change Reference to Value
- Replace Derived Variable with Query
- Extract Method
- Encapsulate Variable
- Combine Methods into Class
