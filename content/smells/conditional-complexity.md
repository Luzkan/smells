## Conditional Complexity

In data-oriented programming, the usage of `switch`-like statements (lengthy, cascading `if` statements or `switch`/`case`) should be relatively rare. One such switch usually executes code scattered around the code base and should usually be replaced with a polymorphism solution.

This smell was phrased initially as _Switch Statement_ by Fowler and Beck back in 1999 [[1](#sources)]. One year later, Mäntylä noted that such a name is misleading since switch statements do not necessarily imply a code smell but rather just in the situation when they are used instead of a viable polymorphism solution. [[2](#sources)] Fowler, 14 years later, in his newest book in 2018, changed the name, suggesting _Repeated Switching_, agreeing that, fortuitously due to the way he initially phrased it, conditional statements got a bad reputation, while he never unconditionally opposed the existence of all `if`-s and `switch`-es. [[3](#sources)] In the "Clean Code" by Robert Martin, the smell was called "Prefer Polymorphism to if/else or switch/case", which is lengthy, but it hits the nail on the head. [[4](#sources)]

I provide a typical example of this issue on an `Exporter` class with different file formats. A new `elif` has been added for each new feature instead of using an Object-Oriented solution like the Factory Method.

Keeping a class focused on a single concern is vital to make it more robust. Martin Fowler defines responsibility as a reason to change, concluding that “A class should have only one reason to change.” [[3](#sources)]. An example that violates this would be a class that prints a table that handles both the contents of the cells and the styling of the table.

Another situation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sources, would be a nested `Try` and `Except`/`Catch` "checklist", where numerous error-catching blocks are used instead of one generalized for the situation at hand.

### Causation

The most common way such a smell can be created is when a conditional switch behavior is used instead of creating a new class. The first time it happens is not yet a "scent-ish" smell, but this immediately becomes a saturated red flag as soon as it is done the second time [[5](#sources)]. Logic blocks grew over time more extensive, and no one bothered to implement an Object-Oriented Programming style alternative like decorator, strategy, or state. It was easier to add another `else if`.

### Problems

#### **Open-Closed Principle Violation**

The class should be open for extension but closed for modification

#### **More Complex APIs**

#### **Comprehensibility**

If statement blocks make things harder to understand as they require to think about all the possible paths the logic can go.

#### **Unnecessary Indirection**

Most likely, there is a way to execute one method on a polymorphic class instead of switching cases.

#### **Increased Test Complexity**

Each subsequent if branch needs each subsequent test.

### Examples

<div class="example-block">

#### Smelly

```py
class Exporter:
    def export(self, export_format: str):
        if export_format == 'wav':
            self.exportInWav()
        elif export_format == 'flac':
            self.exportInFlac()
        elif export_format == 'mp3':
            self.exportInMp3()
        elif export_format == 'ogg':
            self.exportInOgg()
```

#### Solution

```py
class Exporter:
    def export(self, export_format: str):
        exporter = self.get_format_factory(export_format)
        exporter.export()
    def get_format_factory(self, export_format: str):
        if export_format in self.export_format_factories:
            return render_factory[export_format]
        raise MissingFormatException
            ...

```

</div>

### Refactoring:

- Use a Guard Clause
- Extract Conditional
- Replace with Polymorphism
- Use Strategy Pattern
- Use Null Object
- Use Functional Programming Based Solution
