## Duplicated Code

Duplicated Code does not need further explanation. According to Fowler, redundant code is one of the worst smells [[1](#sources)]. One thing is that this makes it more challenging to read the program. Checking whether the copies are identical is yet another issue - looking at whether there are for sure no tiny differences between code blocks in search of [Oddball Solution](./oddball-solution.md) further unnecessarily absorbs developer time. Yet another thing is that whenever a change is made, one needs to check if this should have happened to just one or all of the existing copies of code, wherever they are.
