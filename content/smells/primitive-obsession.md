## Primitive Obsession

Whenever a variable that is just a simple `string`, or an `int` simulates being a more abstract concept, which could be an object, we encounter a _Primitive Obsession_ code smell. This lack of abstraction quickly becomes a problem whenever there is the need for any additional logic, and also because these variables easily spread wide and far in the codebase. This alleged verbal abstraction is just a "supposed" object, but it should have a real object instead.

### Causation

Possibly a missing class to represent the concept in the first place. Mäntylä gives an example of representing money as primitive rather than creating a separate class [[1](#sources)], and so does Fowler, who states that many programmers are reluctant to create their own fundamental types. [[2](#sources)]. Higher-level abstraction knowledge is needed to clarify or simplify the code. [[3](#sources)

### Problems

#### **Hidden Intention**

The type does not correspond to a variable's value (i.e., phone number as a string).

#### **Lack of Encapsulation**

These primitives often go in groups, and there’s a lack of written relations between them, and nothing protects them from external manipulation.

### Example

<div class="example-block">

#### Smelly

```py
birthday_date: str = "1998-03-04"
name_day_date: str = "2021-03-20"
```

#### Solution

```py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Date:
    year: int
    month: int
    day: int

    def __str__(self):
      return f"{self.year}-{self.month}-{self.day}"

birthday: Date = Date(1998, 03, 04)
name_day: Date = Date(2021, 03, 20)
```

_Note:_ the above solution is a technical solution example. Practically it is a [Clever Code](./clever-code.md) code smell - in Python there is built-in [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html).

### Refactoring:

- Replace Data Value with Object
- Extract Class
- Introduce Parameter Object
- Replace Array with Object
- Replace Type Code with Class
- Replace Type Code/Conditional Logic with State/Strategy
- Move Embellishment to Decorator
