## Middle Man

The class that only performs delegation work to other classes is called a _Middle Man_. This is the opposite of the [Message Chains](./message-chain.md). Encapsulation (hiding internal details) in the world of Object-Oriented Programming is a typical pattern [[1](#sources)]. However, the problem arises when it goes too far - Fowler specified that it could be said that it's terrible when half of the methods are delegators [[2](#sources)]. M채ntyl채 wrote that this is a problem when every time a new method has to be created, it requires the delegators to be modified with them [[1](#sources)].

### Causation

This can happen due to over-zealous refactorization of Message Chains.

### Problems

#### **Readability**

Without proper, meaningful, unambiguous naming for the delegation method, the developer might need to check what is precisely being called to be sure.

#### **Unnecessary Indirection**

Holding references instead of actual values might slightly increase project complexity in volume.

### Examples

<div class="example-block">

Note: Yes, what is smelly from _Middle Man_'s perspective might be a solution to [Message Chain](./message-chain.md).

#### Smelly

```py
class Minion:
    _location: Location

    def action(self):
        ...
        if self.is_frontline():
            ...

    def is_frontline(self)
        return self._location.is_frontline()


class Location:
    _field: Field

    def is_frontline(self)
        return self._field.is_frontline()


class Field:
    def is_frontline(self)
        ...
```

#### Solution

```py
class Minion:
    _location: Location

    def action(self):
        ...
        if self._location.field.is_frontline():
            ...

class Location:
    field: Field

class Field:
    def is_frontline(self)
        ...
```

</div>

### Exceptions

In the context of the system as a whole, some communication between modules must take place. All possibilities should be properly balanced so that none of the smells dominate ([Global Data](./global-data.md), [Tramp Data](./tramp-data.md), [Message Chain](./message-chain.md), [Middle Man](./middle-man.md)) to make the entire codebase as straightforward as possible.

### Refactoring:

- Remove Middle Man _(note: this might create [Message Chain](./message-chain.md))_
- Inline Method
- Replace Delegation with Inheritance
- Replace Superclass with Delegate
